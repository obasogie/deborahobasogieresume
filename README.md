## 🔍 Project Overview

This Web3-enabled resume site highlights my background as an Information Technology Consultant by combining traditional front-end design with blockchain technologies.

### ✨ Features
- **Responsive HTML/CSS layout** styled to match a professional print resume
- **Interactive JavaScript footer** displaying live smart contract deployment date from the Ethereum Sepolia testnet
- **Permanent backup on IPFS**, ensuring a decentralized, tamper-proof version of my resume
- **Deployed on GitHub Pages**, making it easily accessible and public

### 🔗 Technologies Used
- `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript`
- `Solidity` smart contracts deployed via Remix IDE
- `Web3.js` for interacting with the Ethereum contract
- `IPFS` for decentralized hosting (via Pinata)
- `GitHub` and `GitHub Pages` for open-source versioning and public deployment

### 🔐 Smart Contract
The Solidity smart contract includes a read-only structure of my resume sections. It was deployed to the Sepolia Ethereum testnet and contains:
- Contact info
- Summary
- Proficiencies
- Training
- Experience
- Work history
- Education

### 📁 IPFS Deployment
Files were packaged and uploaded to IPFS to ensure permanent, content-addressed access to the site, accessible even without centralized servers.
